### 💡 Who Am I?

I’m a passionate Software Engineer in Test with a hacker's mindset and a builder's heart. While I’m already deep in automation—writing frameworks, simulating chaos, owning CI/CD—I'm currently leveling up my backend skills to become a complete force in software engineering.

- 🧠 Built a **cloud-integrated automation framework** from scratch (yes, scratch 💥)  
- 🕹️ Simulated **20+ concurrent user sessions** via load testing (Node.js + Playwright + Shell scripting = chef’s kiss)  
- 🧪 Automated **LLM & ASR model testing** — because testing AI deserves more than "it works"  
- 🌐 Exploring full-stack with **Spring Boot, React, MongoDB** on the side
