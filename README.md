## 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer in Test** with a knack for breaking systems and building robust solutions. With a hacker's mindset and a builder's heart, I thrive on crafting automation frameworks, orchestrating chaos in load tests, and mastering CI/CD pipelines. Currently, I'm leveling up my **backend development** skills to become a full-stack powerhouse.

- 🧠 Architected a **cloud-integrated automation framework** from the ground up  
- 🕹️ Simulated **20+ concurrent user sessions** with load testing (Node.js + Playwright + Shell scripting = 🔥)  
- 🧪 Automated testing for **LLM & ASR models** — because AI deserves rigorous validation  
- 🌐 Diving into full-stack with **Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB**  
- 🎯 Always learning, always coding, always breaking things (intentionally)
